Docker + docker-compose for isolated, reproducible Minecraft servers

Tailscale for secure remote access and LAN-free play

Git for managing configuration, server types, and automation scripts

systemd + cron for auto-start and scheduled backups

Optional server.properties, mods/, config/, and other assets

Compatibility with itzg/minecraft-server Docker image
